                    <p>
                        Blizzard Entertainment is an American company based in Irvine, California. </br>
                        They are known for developing video games such as World of Warcraft, Overwatch, Warcraft, the Diablo series and the StarCraft series. </br>
                        The company is a subsidary of Activision Blizzard and was founded on February 8th, 1991. </br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Blizzard Entertainment was founded by Michael Morhaime, Allen Adham, and Frank Pearce, who all earned their bachelor's degrees from UCLA in 1990. </br>
                        The company was originally named Silicon & Synapse before undergoing a series of name changes. </br>
                        The founders finally renamed the company "Blizzard Entertainment" in May 1994
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Since 1991, Blizzard Entertainment has developed 19 games, with 11 of those games being within the the Warcraft, Diablo, and StarCraft series. </br>
                        Since the releases of Warcraft: Orcs & Humans (1994), Diablo (1997), and StarCraft (1998), Blizzard has focused almost exclusively on those three series.

                    <h3>STARCRAFT</h3>

                    <p>
                        Planning for the development of the original StarCraft game began in 1995, shortly after the release of Warcraft II.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        StarCraft was released internationally on March 31st, 1998 and subsequently became the best-selling PC game for that year, with over 1.5 million sales worldwide. </br>
                        And by May 2007, StarCraft had sold over 9.5 million copies around the world, with 4.5 million copies being sold in South Korea. </br>
                        On the 1st November 2010, StarCraft received the Guinness World Record for "best selling strategy game for PC" and "longest-serving Esports game".
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Soon after its release, the game received cult-like status in the computer gaming world. </br>
                        StarCraft still remains popular today due to its complexity and depth of the strategic possibilities. </br>
                        In South Korea, the series popularity has been especially high, with nationally recognized tournaments and intense training camps across the country. </br>
                        Live tournaments are often televised, with top players receiving mild celebrity status.

                    <h4>DEVELOPMENT OF STARCRAFT II</h4>

                    <p>
                        On May 19th 2007, at the Blizzard Worldwide Invitational in Seoul, South Korea, Blizzard Entertainment announced the development of StarCraft II.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The team devoted to StarCraft II consisted of 40 developers, including 12 developers who had worked on the original game. </br>
                        As of 2008, the team consisted of four or five managers, 12-14 programmers, 8-10 artists and around 10 designers, including lead designers Kevin Dong and Ryan Schutter. </br>
                        By June of 2009, the team had expanded to 50 members and by August of the same year it had grew to a further 60 members.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Compared to its precursor, StarCraft II was designed with a primary focus on the multiplayer aspect, with one of the main goals being to recreate the multiplayer of the original game in 3D. </br>
                        Developers placed an emphasis on designing the game specifically around competitive, skill-based Esports. </br>
                        A new competitive ladder system for ranked games and new matchmaking mechanics used to match players of equal skill level were also integrated into the game.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        During development, there were five levels of AI difficulty created for custom games: Beginner, Easy, Moderate, Hard, and Insane. </br>
                        This gradually expanded to ten levels: Very Easy, Easy, Medium, Hard, Harder, Very Hard, Elite, and three different Cheater options.
                    </p>
