                    <h2>STARCRAFT II: WINGS OF LIBERTY</h2>
                    <p>
                        StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty is a science fiction real-time strategy game that was developed by Blizzard Entertainment. It was released worldwide in July 2010 for Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X. </br>
                        The game is split into three installments: Wings of Liberty (the Terran campaign), Heart of the Swarm (the Zerg campaign) and Legacy of the Void (the Protoss campaign). </br>
                        In 2016, Blizzard released StarCraft II: Nova Covert Ops, a series of 9 missions released over a trio of installments.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        StarCraft II is a sequal to 1998 release StarCraft and like its predecessor consists of three races: Terran, Zerg and Protoss. </br>
                        The Terrans are Humans that have been exiled from Earth, The Zerg are a race of insectoid aliens and the Protoss are a technologically advanced humanoid species. </br>
                        The game is also set four years after the events of Blizzard's 1998 Brood War and includes new and returning characters and locations from the original game.
                    </p>

                                The StarCraft II experience places emphasis on the three playable races locked in intra-galactic warfare. </br>
                                This narrative can be explored through a story campaign, competitive online multiplayer and collaborative co-op missions.
                            <p>
                                In any given match, the objective is to destroy your opponent's structures and units using your own fighting forces. </br>
                                At the start of each match, each player is given worker units who are capable of gathering basic mineral resources. </br>
                                These can be used to start harvesting other materials and build increasingly powerful units and structures. </br>
                                There is also a supply cap, which forces players to build supply structures in order to continue building new units.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Each race has its own tech tree which can be explored as players make progress in a match. </br>
                                A tech tree allows you to build new structures and units.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                StarCraft II features approximately the same number of units as the original StarCraft. </br>
                                Many units from the original game were brought to the sequal, some featuring new upgrades and abilities.
