                    <p>
                        Team Liquid is a pro gaming team that was founded in November 2000 by Victor Goossens. </br>
                        A clan for StarCraft II was created in 2010 and Team Liquid subsequently signed their first professional players. </br>
                        Soon after, Team Liquid became one of the most successful teams, winning four DreamHacks, two MLGs, two Assemblies, and one NASL.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After the release of StarCraft II, the team signed a partnership agreement with Old Generations, a South Korean organisation. </br>
                        This allowed Team Liquid to become the first foreign team to be involved in the Korean StarCraft scene on a regular basis.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The team's StarCraft II roster currently consists of six players and has a diverse national pool, with players from Germany, Poland, Netherlands, South Korea and France.
