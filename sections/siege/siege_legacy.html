                    <h2>THE DYNASTY OF PENTA ESPORTS</h2>
                    <p>
                        Penta Esports has been in the scene since the release of the game back in 2015.
                        They were the winners of the first ever Major, Year 1 Season 1, of the game and have dominated the season for  large period of time.</br>
                        Up until recently, the roster has been the same since the very beginning.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The players were; Fabian, their team captain, Goga, titled the best support in the game, jNszki who was their entry fragger, Kantoraketti, who was their other entry fragger, and finally, Pengu, who is recognised as one of the best players in the world, to date, and is the remaining player still playing for the roster with G2 esports.</br>
                        In the year of 2018, Penta was leading a dynasty throughout the whole year.
                        They have won every possible competition they could have won including the Six Invitational that year.
                    </p>

                    <div class="images">
                        <img src="images/penta.png" alt="Penta">
                    </div>

                    <p>
                        In 2019, before they started competing in that years’ Invite, they were picked up by a superteam among the esports scene in all esports games known as G2 esports.</br>
                        That Invite, they won the competition for the second time in a row and it seemed like they had a fantastic future ahead of them. </br>
                        In the Raleigh Major in 2019 was the first major loss this team had had in the past year and a half and were beaten by the new superteam then known as Team Empire.</br>
                        This was the end of their great dynasty as they never got back in the shape that they were in the year before.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now, Pengu is the only remaining player on that roster with 4 new players. </br>
                        That are basically a brand new team and a good one at that as they still attend majors just no longer as favourites. </br>
                        To this day they still haven’t gotten back in the shape they were before and who can say, they just might have a second dynasty in the future.
