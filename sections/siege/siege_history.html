                    <h2>HISTORY</h2>
                    <p>
                        Rainbow Six: Siege was released on December 1st, 2015.
                        It was released with massive hype as the E3 trailer that year showed the realism and hardcore “If you’re  dead, you’re dead for the round”.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Unfortunately, the game did not live up to the hype.
                        It released as a buggy mess and was overrun with hackers. </br>
                        The game was declining exponentially at first, as the game was almost unplayable because of the horrible servers so no one could play the game properly on top of all the problems above.
                        <div class="images">
                            <img src="images/history_siege.jpg" alt="Siege History">
                        </div>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Even though the game was going through a massive decline and was, in turn, a failure, Ubisoft kept releasing updates every few months that included a number of bug fixes and quality of life changes. </br>
                        After months and months of changes, players started returning to the game as Ubisoft has been gradually fixing all these problems.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Regardless of the fact that the developers have been fixing all these problems that the game had, there were still huge problems within the game’s core code which the current game devs could not understand as the developers that wrote the code no longer worked for Ubisoft.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Obviously, this is a huge problem as they could not tamper or try to fix the code, especially in a live service game. </br>
                        Because of the problem above, Ubisoft had made a decision that would either make or break the game.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        They had announced that they would spend a whole season, which, in Siege is a span of 3 months, just focusing on trying to understand this core code and try to change it in such a way where it would be infinitely easier to fix future problems.<br>
                        In the end, the company managed to turn the code into their own and made it easier for them to fully understand the algorithms. Along with fixing this problem, at the end of the season, they have released pages upon pages of bug fixes.<br>
                        Without this time to spend fixing this, the game wouldn’t be where it is today. </br>
                        Today, Siege has over 60 million players and is recognised as a tier 1 Esport.
