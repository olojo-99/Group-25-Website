                    <h2>SIX INVITATIONALS</h2>
                    <p>
                        The Rainbow Six Invitational is a tournament that takes place every year in January.
                        It is the biggest tournament in the game and it ultimately determines which team is the best team in the world.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The teams that are determined to compete in the competition is depending on how many points a team has. 
                        Throughout the year, the Esports teams in the highest league play their seasons out as normal in their respective regions.<br>
                        Depending on where they are placed, they get a certain number of points.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The top 4 teams in each region play a mini major and depending on where they are placed in the major, they get their respective bonus points.<br>
                        At the end of the year, all the points are added up and the top 16 teams with the most points are invited to the Invitationals.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    But as there are 20 spaces available for the tournament, in all 4 regions, there is a competition called the closed qualifiers.<br>
                    This can be any team that is not qualified to Invite already, or a team in the second division.
                    </p>

                    <div class="images">
                        <img src="images/siege teams comp.jpg" alt="Siege teams">
                    </div>

                    <p>
                    In the end, 1 team in each region takes 1 of the 4 spots available.<br>
                    In the month of January, all the teams that were invited fly to Montreal in Canada. </br>
                    This is where the stadium is located in which they are going to play in.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    As for the system for the tournament, each team is put into Groups and the top 2 teams in each group proceed to the brackets after playing each other.
                    In the brackets, there will be the top 10 teams playing. They play their given team and whether they win or lose, they are put in the winners or losers bracket.<br>
                    The losers bracket is where the teams have lost get a second chance to stay in the competition but if they lose there, they are knocked out.<br>
                    As for the winners bracket the loser goes down to the losers bracket. This happens until there is one team in the winners and losers bracket where both teams will compete in a best of 5 in the grand finals.<br>
                    But, as the team in the winners bracket have not lost a game up to that point, they get one map for free.
