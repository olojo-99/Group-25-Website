                    <h2>TEAMS</h2>
                    <p>
                        As the Rainbow Six Esports scene is a very new Esport, there are not a lot of large esports teams in the scene compared to other tier 1 esports such as Counter Strike or League Of Legends.<br>
                        But this does not mean that there aren’t any large organisations in the scene.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In Europe, there are large organisations such as G2 who are in Germany, Empire who are in Russia, Vitality and BDS who are both French teams and Natus Vincere who are a team from the UK.<br>
                        Out of these teams, team Vitality is the only team that has been in the scene since the game’s beta 5 years ago. </br>
                        But super teams such as G2 and BDS have been in the scene for about 3 years and have helped develop the esport.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        APAC, which stands for Asia Pacific, is by far the smallest and weakest region with the least exposure. </br>
                        But this region has very large teams nonetheless such as; Fnatic, who are located in Australia, and Cloud9 and Nora Rengo who are both located in Japan.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In LATAM, which stand for Latin America, there are a huge number of large organisations which are all located in Brazil such as Team Liquid, NIP, Faze Clan, Team One and Immortals. </br>
                        As you can see, this region has so many large teams and is a very competitive region as a result of that.<br>
                        As for the NA region, out of the 8 teams that compete in this region, there are 4 teams that dominate the region so the league is very lob-sided.<br>
                        These 4 teams, which all have a house in Vegas, as this region is a LAN so they don’t play online. These teams are Spacestation Gaming, Darkzero, TSM and Oxygen.
                    </p>
