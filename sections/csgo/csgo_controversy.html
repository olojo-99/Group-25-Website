            <h3>Build Up</h3>
            <p class="content">This controversy is seen as one of the biggest scandals in CS:GO history. This took place in 2014 between two teams, iBuyPower and NetCodeGuides. The two teams played on August 21st 2014. iBuyPower was seen as a much stronger team but they lost 16 - 4 in what was seen as a bizarre game.<br> 
                The iBuyPower players were seen trying to knife-kill the opponents and doing tactics that no team would ever do in a professional tournament. This led a reporter publishing screenshots of a conversation between Shazeb “ShaZam” Khan (professional player) and his friends, saying that the match was fixed.<br> 
                The allegations were denied and largely forgotten about until an ex-girlfriend of Derek "dboorn" Boorn (a player that was on the iBuyPower roster) showed texts between her and dboorn in which he admits to match fixing and using colluding NetCodeGuide founder Casey foster to place bets on a gambling website called CS Lounge. <br>
                They did this by getting Duc Pham(professional player) to bet on the site using nine alternate accounts. In return for match fixing the players were offered skins which are a cosmetic item to change the appearance of your weapon in CS:GO. Some of these skins are very expensive going for up to thousands of dollars.

                <h3>Valve's Response</h3>
                <p class="content">Once this was all released Valve released a statement permanently banning seven people from Valve related tournaments.<br> 
                    Casey Foster, the founder of NetCodeGuides was banned along with Sam "DaZeD" Marine, Joshua "steel" Nissan, Braxton "swag" Pierce and Keven "AZK" Larivière,  Duc "cud" Pham and Derek "dboorn" Boorn. There was one player involved in iBuyPower who was not banned and this was Tyler “Skadoodle” Latham who did not accept the skins. This was one of the most controversial events ever to happen in CS:GO professional play and the players who were banned had to pursue other careers as their careers were essentially over.<br>  
                    The aforementioned players are still banned to this day.
