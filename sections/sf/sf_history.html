                    <h2>HISTORY AND DEVELOPMENT</h2>

                        <p> I’ll first talk about the origin of the Street Fighter franchise which started off everything and how it became popular amongst players. </br>
                            Street Fighter is a fighting video game franchise developed and published by Capcom. </br>
                            The first game in the series was released in 1987, followed by five other main series games, various spin-offs and crossovers and numerous appearances in various other media. </br>
                            Its best-selling 1991 release Street Fighter 2 is credited with establishing many of the conventions of the one-on-one fighting genre. </br>
                            Street Fighter became so popular that it was one of the highest-grossing video game franchises of all time and serves as one of Capcom's flagship series with total sales of 45 million units worldwide as of December 31, 2019. </br>
                            It is also the highest-grossing media franchise of all time based on a fighting game at $12.2 billion. 
                        </p>

                        <div class="images">

                        </div>

                        <p> The game was designed by Takashi Nishiyama and Hiroshi Matsumoto. </br>
                            In this game, the player plays as martial artist Ryu, who competes in a worldwide martial arts tournament spanning five countries and 10 opponents. </br>
                            A second player can join in and play as Ryu's American rival, Ken. </br>
                            The player can perform three punch and kick attacks, each varying in speed and strength, and three special attacks: the Hadouken, Shoryuken, and Tatsumaki Senpukyaku, performed by executing special joystick and button combinations. 
                        </p>

                        <figcaption>Takashi Nishiyama and Hiroshi Matsumoto</figcaption>
                    
                    <p> Street Fighter was ported to many popular home computer systems of the time, like the PC. </br>
                        In 1987, it was released on the NEC Avenue TurboGrafx-CD console as Fighting Street. </br>
                        Street Fighter was later included in Capcom Classics Collection: Remixed for the PlayStation Portable, and Capcom Classics Collection Vol. 2 for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox. 
                    </p>
                    <p> The most popular game out of the Street Fighter franchise is Street Fighter 2 which was released in 1991 following an unsuccessful attempt to brand the 1989 beat 'em up game Final Fight as the Street Fighter sequel. </br>
                        It was one of the earliest arcade games for Capcom's CP System hardware and was designed by Akira Nishitani and Akira Yasuda. 
                    </p>
                    <p> Street Fighter II was the first one-on-one fighting game to give players a choice from a variety of player characters with different moves, allowing for more varied matches. </br>
                        Each player character had a unique fighting style with approximately 30 or more moves, including then-new grappling moves and throws, as well as two or three special attacks. </br>
                        In the single-player mode, the player character is pitted sequentially against the seven other main characters before confronting the final four boss opponents, who consist of CPU-controlled characters not selectable by the player. </br>
                        As in the original, a second player could join in at any point during single player mode and compete against the other player in competitive matches. 
                    </p>

                        Street Fighter V was released exclusive to the PlayStation 4 and PC, enabling cross platform gameplay, in 2016. </br>
                        In 2018, the game received a major update, Street Fighter V: Arcade Edition and in 2020, Street Fighter V: Champion Edition was released as downloadable content. </br>
